      Dear valued customer,
    </ion-card-header>

    <ion-card-content>

      Thank you for using the services of M&F. We appreciate your business.
      Due to the current public health situation, we are working hard to provide our customers access to foodstuffs you
      need to keep your family healthy through the period of this global pandemic. As you may be well aware, it’s been
      busy and the lockdown also impacts our delivery time and prices. We have therefore decided that starting <span style="color: #781318">Monday
      April 20, all deliveries will be made 1 day after the order has been received.</span>

   As you may be aware, prices of items on the market have been changing on a daily basis and prices
      provided on the M&F app may not reflect prices on the market. We therefore cannot guarantee the price of any item
      at this moment. <span style="color: #781318">We will purchase selected items at market price but we promise to negotiate the best price with
      our vendors.</span>
      We apologize for any inconveniences this may cause and it’s our hope and prayer that things will return to normal
      conditions soon.
      We hope you and you family will remain safe and healthy.<br><br>

      M&F Customer Service
